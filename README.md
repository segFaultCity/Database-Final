# H3 Description of our application
Our application is designed to be used as a restaurant hostess application. Our programâ€™s main goal is to help hostesses stay organized through an easy to use interface. The hostess can change the status of a table to reserved, walk-in, or empty and easily identify them by a change in color. This can eliminate confusion between hostesses by making the process easier, faster, and more reliable.
